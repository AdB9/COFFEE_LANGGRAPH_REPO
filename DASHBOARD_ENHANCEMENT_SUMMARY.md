## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **File Upload Handling**
- Support for CSV and Excel formats
- Column validation (date, actual, predicted)
- Automatic data processing and feature engineering
- Error handling with clear user feedback

### **Backend Integration**
- Async graph execution with proper error handling
- Configuration from UI parameters
- Session state persistence
- Fallback to demo mode for reliability

### **Data Processing Pipeline**
```python
# Uploaded file processing
eval_df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(eval_df['date'], errors='coerce')
eval_df['absolute_delta'] = abs(eval_df['actual'] - eval_df['predicted'])
eval_df['percentage_error'] = (eval_df['absolute_delta'] / eval_df['actual']) * 100
eval_df['is_huge_difference'] = eval_df['absolute_delta'] >= error_threshold
```

### **Alpha Discovery Integration**
```python
# Real backend system integration
config = cast(RunnableConfig, {
    "configurable": {
        "analysis_period_days": analysis_days,
        "k_worst_cases": min(5, len(analysis['top_error_windows'])),
        "enable_geospatial": enable_geospatial,
        "enable_web_news": enable_web_news
    }
})

result = asyncio.run(graph.ainvoke(initial_state, config=config))
```
