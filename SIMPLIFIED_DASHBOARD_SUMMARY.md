# Alpha Seeker Dashboard - Simplified Version

## 🎯 Core Concept

The dashboard now demonstrates a simple and focused concept:

1. **Existing Model Results** - Show evaluation plots and metrics from your ML model
2. **Error Analysis** - Identify when and where predictions fail
3. **Alpha Discovery** - Use intelligent agents to find external factors that explain the errors
4. **Feature Generation** - Convert discoveries into new model features

## 📊 Dashboard Structure

### **Top Section: Model Evaluation Results**
- ✅ **Evaluation Plots Image** (`data/evaluation_plots.png`) - Shows model performance analysis
- ✅ **Model Evaluation Summary** (`data/model_evaluation.png`) - Shows error distribution & metrics
- ✅ **Simple Alpha Discovery Button** - Triggers the analysis process

### **Tab 1: Model Performance Analysis**
- Interactive charts showing actual vs predicted prices
- Error distribution analysis over time
- Key metrics and performance indicators

### **Tab 2: Error Window Detection**
- Top prediction failures identified
- Time windows around error events
- Pattern analysis of when the model fails

### **Tab 3: Alpha Discovery Process**
- Simple 3-step process explanation:
  1. **Analyze Errors** - Find prediction failures
  2. **Search Context** - Use agents to find external data
  3. **Find Alpha** - Generate new feature signals
- Real-time agent status during analysis

### **Tab 4: Discovered Alpha Indicators**
- Detailed analysis results with reasoning
- Statistical significance and correlation data
- Implementation guidance for each indicator

### **Tab 5: Next Steps**
- How to use the discovered features
- Code examples and integration guidance
- Implementation roadmap

## 🔍 Alpha Discovery Process

### **Input**: 
- Existing model evaluation data (`data/evaluation_results.csv`)
- Historical price context (`data/dataset.csv`)
- Model performance visualizations (PNG images)

### **Process**:
1. **Error Analysis** - System identifies the biggest prediction failures
2. **Context Search** - Agents search for external factors during error periods:
   - 🛰️ **Geospatial Agent**: Weather, drought, satellite imagery
   - 📰 **Web News Agent**: Market events, sentiment, announcements  
   - 🚛 **Logistics Agent**: Port delays, supply chain issues
3. **Alpha Generation** - Correlate external data with prediction errors
4. **Feature Creation** - Generate actionable indicators for model enhancement

### **Output**:
- List of alpha indicators with detailed reasoning
- Statistical validation and significance testing
- Implementation guidance and code examples

## 🚀 Key Benefits

- **Simple Concept**: Shows how existing model evaluation leads to alpha discovery
- **Visual Impact**: Model evaluation images provide immediate understanding
- **Real Analysis**: Connects to actual Alpha Seeker backend system
- **Practical Output**: Generates implementable feature improvements

## 📱 How to Use

```bash
# Launch the dashboard
source .venv/bin/activate
streamlit run alpha_dashboard.py
```

1. **View Model Results** - See the evaluation plots showing your model's current performance
2. **Click Alpha Discovery** - Run the analysis to find new indicators
3. **Review Insights** - Examine detailed reasoning for each discovered alpha signal
4. **Implement Features** - Follow the guidance to add new features to your model

## 🎯 The Story

> "We have a coffee price prediction model that works reasonably well, but still makes some significant errors. Instead of just accepting these failures, the Alpha Seeker system investigates *why* they happened by searching for external factors the model missed. This discovers new alpha indicators that can be added as features to reduce future prediction errors."

This creates a clear narrative from existing model → error analysis → alpha discovery → model improvement.
